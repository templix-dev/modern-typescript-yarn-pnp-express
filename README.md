# Modern express.js with TypeScript

A **minimal boilerplate** for building [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) application with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and yarn PnP. Why yarn PnP? Because it is fast and modern package manager.

It also use [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org) to bundle the application for production. I create `bin` folder to store some script to run the application.

It use:
- TypeScript
- express.js
- Node.js (ESM module)
- Rollup.js
- Yarn PnP (No `node_modules`)
